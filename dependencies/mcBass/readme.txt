Documentation to be written.

If you want to recompile this dll, you'll need PureBasic, the lua libs and includes. The
forum post for the includes is at:
http://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?p=127487
The libs can be found at http://luabinaries.sf.net.
You'll also need bass and the purebasic bass support. Both can be found on the bass website, un4seen.com.
