AvSound: Sounds and Substitutions for Avalon; the Legend Lives

Installation is simple: put AvSound.xml into your worlds\plugins directory and load it as you would any other plugin. Also put the sounds folder in the worlds directory.
There are a few plugins required to make this plugin work correctly found in the dependencies folder: MushReader, MCBase and channel_history.
Install these as in the same manner as AvSound. In the case of MushReader and MCBase, put the dlls in your main Mushclient folder.
The Extras folder contains some other handy plugins I use and enjoy. They are all fairly straightforward.

To make the prompt work correctly, go to the view menu and disable all toolbars except the info bar. I haven't been able to make this work on NVDA yet - JFW is the only system I have tested this thoroughly with. If you are an NVDA user who knows their stuff, get in touch and we'll figure out how to make it work.

There are several settings in here that include my name as part of the trigger. Maybe one day I will add in a variable to set your character name, but for now just replace all instances of Agarwain with your own character.

Queries, bug reports, feature suggestions (and pull requests!) can be submitted through Github in the normal manner or submitted on the relevant Meetplace forum.

Enjoy!
